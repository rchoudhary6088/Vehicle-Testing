A software to calculate the contributing factors in a rally race to predict a drivers behaviours and driving profile when your GPS data is lost for a short period of time. 
The coding was done to calculate, minimum and maximum steering angle, percentage of foot and hand brake used, the distance covered and the drivers profile during the lost signal.
